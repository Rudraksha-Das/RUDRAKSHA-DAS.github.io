<h1>Wassup guys?</h1>

If you have encountered this repo, you might be curious regardng content spoofing and searching for some sites that create popup when any non-existent path or anywhere is entered for. If that is the fact, you are at the right place! You can use my github pages to test for popups allowed from iframes or even create PoC for demonstration of content spoofing. 

**Ways to use:** 
- You can request for any non-existent path to trigger a popup.
- You can request `/` for demonstrating iframe injection at a vulnerable endpoint.

If you have suggestions or potential ideas for improvements, feel free to see here!

Time to hack Guys, don't waste in nonsense socials!
